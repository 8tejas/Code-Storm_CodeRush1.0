# EEG Classification using CNN-BiLSTM

This project focuses on classifying EEG (Electroencephalography) signals to detect schizophrenia using deep learning.  
It uses a hybrid **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** and **Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM)** model to extract spatial and temporal features from EEG data.

## Technologies & Libraries Used

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- scikit-learn

The model is trained on EEG datasets, with preprocessing (standardization) and deep learning techniques like CNNs for feature extraction and BiLSTMs for sequence learning.
